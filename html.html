		Nowadays, Moroccan children have cultivated tremendously toxic and non-environment friendly habits. Throwing garbage anywhere is relevant to this issue. Trash cans apparently became old-fashioned and quiet unnecessary.
		Finding ways to fix this issue through an entertaining game seems to be promising.
		“Game” is a game that intends to cheer and congratulate the player whenever he reaches an amount of points. He will move the garbage can in order to collect trash. The higher the can collects, the higher its speed will get.
